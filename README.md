# Splitwise CLI - add a new expense for a person, group

In the effort to learn more about Python, OAuth, the Splitwise API, and builing a 
command-line client in Python, I thought it would be fun to write a small client that 
allowed you to add a new expense. For me, this is the most common Splitwise use case. 
The other [Splitwise client](https://github.com/namaggarwal/splitwise) I found seems 
to work well, but only supports GET requests, so won't work for adding a new expense.

The code here is a significant work in progress.
